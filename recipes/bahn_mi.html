            <p>If there is somewhere an actual building housing a Sandwich Hall of Fame, we know two things for sure. First of all, we really, really want to go there! (Who wouldn't?) 
                Secondly, one of the biggest exhibits must be devoted to the bánh mì, one of the all-time sandwich greats due to its unique blend of different flavors and cultural influences. The bánh mì, as its name implies, 
                comes from Vietnam, but it reflects the influence of the French colonists who had occupied this country prior to the Vietnam War. As Cooking With Lane explains it, a traditional bánh mì shows the French influence 
                in the use of a baguette and also the inclusion of pâté.
